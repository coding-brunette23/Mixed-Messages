# Mixed-Messages

This is a small project showcasing my newly learnt JavaScript skills.

## Affirmation messages
Each time the user runs the program, a random affirmation pops up on the screen.

* The code uses two arrays: one to store the affirmation strings, and second to store the prefixes.
* The messages are generated by calling a random number
* The string and prefix are then combined to get the final affirmation message.

These affirmation messages will bring positivity in your daily life.
